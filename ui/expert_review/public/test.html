          <p>
            We have asked two different groups of coders to judge a number of  social media posts regarding whether or not they criticize the elite (and if so, how).
            For each post, up to three questions had to be answered.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have aggregated these judgments for each post, each question, and each group into a set of labels.
            For a given posts these labels may disagree due to differences between groups.

        <header>Examples of implicit <em>vs</em> explicit elite criticism</header>
        <content>
          <p>The following two posts contain <b><em>explicit</em> criticism</b> of &lsquo;rich people&rsquo; and the government, and, somewhat more abstract, of &lsquo;those in power&rsquo;.</p>
          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">Tax havens mean that there are rich people who will be able to avoid paying for our hospitals, our schools, our roads, our public services with the complicity of the Liberal government!</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">Given the cancellation of this much needed Primary Care Centre, the Drimnagh community cannot be expected to trust those in power if all their promises are repeatedly being abandoned. ...</p></blockquote>
          <p>In contrast to the above posts, the criticism in the following two posts is <em><b>implicit</b></em>:</p>
          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">Withholding tax, vain reform without an overhaul of the IRPP. New complexities and constraints to try to anesthetize taxpayers ...</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">96% of Spaniards believe that corruption is very high (survey @el_pais). The other 4% must be those who defend #partitocracia vs. democracy</p></blockquote>
          <!-- <p>The implicit target of this criticism is the government and its legislators and bureaucracy. This can be inferred from it suggesting that the 'new complexities and constraints' of the said tax reform were intentionally designed to 'anesthetize taxpayers', or in other words, sedating citizens at large into a state of ignorance.</p> -->

      <div class="example" id="examples_task2">
        <header>Examples of general <em>vs</em> specific criticism</header>
        <content>
          <p>
            To answer question 3, you need to assess whether the elite criticism singles out certain wrong-doings, points of disagreement etc. <em>OR</em> whether it is instead broadly generalizing, for example by asserting an overall lack of integrity, competence, piety, honesty etc.
            Criticisms of the first type are <em>specific</em>.
            Criticisms of the second type are <em>general</em>.
          </p>

          <p>The following post is an example of a <b>general</b> elite criticism:</p>

          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">
            ... the @Popular is not only a structurally corrupt party, tb is structurally authoritarian and leads us towards the biggest rights cut in democracy!
          </p></blockquote>
          
          <p>
            In contrast, the criticisms of the next two posts are <b>specific</b>:
            The first post specifically criticizes &lsquo;the State's&rsquo; failure to appropriately regulate competition.
            This second post criticizes &lsquo;the PD&rsquo; and &lsquo;the left's&rsquo; immigration policy.
          </p>

          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">
            I join the fight of @ETFranchise against the unfair competition of the #grandedistribution which destroys our shops downtown with the complicity of the State! Millions of m2 of illegal sales area! This must stop. #EnTouteFranchise ...
          </p></blockquote>
          
          <blockquote><p class="blockquote-text small">
            HOW DOES THE PD TALK TO STILL RECEPTION AND IMMIGRATION? The left has opened the gates wide, making reception an unmanageable phenomenon. @GiorgioSilli explains to Piero Fassino the errors of the Democratic Party on immigration. ...

          <p>The types of posts that lack any type of implicit or explicit elite criticism is long. Some concrete cases with examples are:<p>
          <ul>
            <!-- <li><em>specific policy-related criticism </em>(e.g. &lsquo;Driving Greece into insolvency and out of control of the Euro would be a poison to Greece and to Europe as a whole. ...&rsquo;) </li> -->

            <li>self-praise (e.g. &lsquo;With #EenHeleGoedeMorgen we work every day on a country that we want to pass on. #teamCDA ...&rsquo;)</li>
            <li>positive appeals to social groups (e.g. &lsquo;The elderly are the victims of the pension policy. According to calculations by @EIBnl, it is precisely the young people who will benefit in the future. 50PLUS has introduced own-initiative law to prevent discounts on pensions! ...&rsquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;service posts&rdquo; and other trivia (e.g. &lsquo;Careful on the roads tonight folks. Massive downpours in some areas. #drivesafe&rsquo;)</li>
